It does three things: it adds a message letting the screen reader user know that the route has successfully changed; it automatically moves focus to that message, and it provides a bypass mechanism (often called a \"skip link\") so that the user can choose to skip to the page's primary content. It also provides a way to customize the definition of a route transition!"
