{{page-title "Reasons to use Ember"}}
<article>
  <p class="intro">Ember is a JavaScript framework that provides everything you need to build a modern web application. While there are lots of reasons to use Ember, the number one reason is this: you'll gain developer productivity by escaping the hype cycle.</p>

  <h2 class="border-bottom">Watch The Documentary</h2>
  <p>Originally named <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3329745" rel="external">Amber.js</a>, the framework was released on December 8th, 2011. After <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3335916" rel="external">some discussion, it was re-named</a> to Ember.js on December 12th.</p>
  <p>Start to learn about Ember by getting to know the history of the framework; its roots may surprise you! In this embedded YouTube video (captions available), made by Honeypot, the creators of the framework talk about the history of Ember, and various community members weigh in with their thoughts about the framework.
  </p>
  <p><strong>TL;DR? With a focus on community and shared solutions, Ember is "the together framework."</strong></p>

  <WeQuote @quoteText="With Ember, I don't need to worry about the little things. My time is spent focused on the behavior my application, not things like what state management library I should use or how I should structure my app. These are conversations I no longer need to have!" @cite="Jai Bhagat, Software Engineer" @citeUrl="https://twitter.com/ChaiWithJai" />

  <h2>The Benefits of Ember</h2>
  <dl class="we-card__container">
    <div class="we-card">
      <dt>Community Owned</dt>
      <dd>No company owns Ember. Ember is free, open source, and always will be. The community is supportive, caring, and has a solid code of conduct.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="we-card">
      <dt>Backwards Compatibility</dt>
      <dd>We don't think that upgrading to the latest version of Ember should break your code. That's why we make new features backwards compatible, and provide a clear upgrade path for our users.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="we-card">
      <dt>Pragmatic Solutions</dt>
      <dd>Ember focuses on solving real-world problems in a way that is approachable for all developers instead of designing entirely new paradigms that can be burdensome for developers to absorb into their workflow. Every new RFC has a section called “How do we teach this”, which helps the core team carefully consider the developer experience before shipping a new feature.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="we-card">
      <dt>Accessibility</dt>
      <dd>Ember's committment to accessibility (a11y) is steadfast. A11y is both part of our official guides, and we also strive to make the guides themselves accessible. We're also the first framework to support a11y checks for both static and dynamic code, through addons such as ember-template-lint and ember-a11y-testing. Our community's a11y working group remains focused on providing the correct solutions to help Ember developers deliver accessible applications.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="we-card">
      <dt>Native Web</dt>
      <dd>Layer your JavaScript on top of HTML. Really! Not only is it completely supported, but it's Ember by default. URLs are king; nested routes can directly translate to well-designed URLs which makes it easier to consider information architecture in your application. Native CSS is the default, too, keeping all your concerns appropriately separated. #useThePlatform</dd>
    </div>
     <div class="we-card">
      <dt>Zero Configuration</dt>
      <dd>By embracing the idea of "convention over configuration", using Ember means you can be productive from day one. No config required. Strong default conventions means we've already done the research and know what most apps need, most of the time. From your terminal, you can type <code>$ ember new my-awesome-app</code> and get started right away.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="we-card">
      <dt>Happy Paths</dt>
      <dd>In Ember, the happy paths are well-lit. The official guides lay out everything you need to know to successfully build an app. See something missing? Anyone can open a pull-request to edit the content!</dd>

  <WeQuote @quoteText="The EmberJS community is what makes Ember special. Not only does the community provide help and support for the technology, it sets a tone and shapes a culture that is intentional and invested in long term success and stability. Those core values permeate everything else." @cite="Mason Hale" @citeUrl="https://twitter.com/masonhale/status/1464662847347171335" />

  <WeQuote @quoteText="The official guides are the best docs I've ever seen. The cheat sheet for the Octane edition of Ember was super helpful because I could see side-by-side code samples to help me upgrade my code." />
